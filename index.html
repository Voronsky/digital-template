<h2>Catch them Dogs!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
  Try your best to catch them dogs!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
  Timing the movements. Ultimately how one can get "higher scores" is by ensuring they are killed, and that they know how to move throughout the map as fast as possible to avoid game over due to time running out.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
  The game is more of the side scroller genre, yet lacking the massive worlds that are normally found within that genre of gaming (e.g Super Mario World, Double Dragon, Contra, etc).
</li>


<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
  "Catch Them Dogs!" is a semi-side scrolling game. Overall, you play as a character whose task in his world is to catch dogs. The game requires that players time their jumps to avoid pesky rabbits that tend to kill the player and reset the game. There is also a timer to keep an eye out for, and if the timer hits zero, the game is instantly reset. The characters and somewhat layout is similar to the Phaser game "Starstruck" but with addon of simple elements such as collectable objects and enemies.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
  Time efficiency and speed. That is, are players quick with their movements to maximize their point gain before time runs out.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
  The unique features is slightly moveable AI. There is an enemy that jumps and moves at random and if the enemy touches the player, the player instantly dies. This adds a bit more of complexity to the concept of "catching the dogs"
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, put it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
  Unfortunately this game has no story outside of an unfortunate guy stuck in an eternal mission to collect dogs in a universe he does not know.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
  Target audience are side scroller type of players.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
  The game normally lasts up to 2 minutes at minimum. Yet if a player exceeds at grabbing the stars which add time, the game can take longer. Although no more than five minutes at most.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
  Time management, that is perfecting jumping times and movements
</li>

<li><strong>Estimated Schedule:</strong>
  A week is how long this game took and normally would take. There was very surface level understanding of javascript prior to this, and the art design is lack luster; usually cropped images from deviant art, or sprite databases which are royalty free. Had there been an graphic designer, the game would of taken at least four days at most.
</li>

<li><strong>Team:</strong>
Briefly describe your capabilities, and then list skills that you might be lacking and would like in potential teammates.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
  The sprites came from either Deviantart,opengameart.org or sprite database such as the MapleStory dog or the main character from phaser's basic examples from the tutorial. The game sounds came from soundBible and the song came from Nujabes - Afternoon

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
  The only other game that would resemble mine would be Starstruck from phaser. The main character is the same, and the movement mechanics are the same but the games are fundamentally different outside of that. The game "Catch Them Dogs!" was mostly made from scratch by basing it off a "D-I-Y" Phaser tutorial.
